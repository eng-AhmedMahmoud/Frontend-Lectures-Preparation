### 2. Accessible Forms (02_accessible_form)
- **Form structure**: `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`
- **Input types**: text, email, password, number, date, etc.
- **Form controls**: `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`
- **Labels and associations**: explicit and implicit labeling
- **Form validation**: HTML5 validation attributes
- **Error messaging** and user feedback
- **Keyboard navigation** and focus management
- **ARIA attributes** for enhanced accessibility

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Build fully accessible forms that work with screen readers
- Implement client-side form validation with HTML5
- Create intuitive user experiences with proper labeling and feedback
- Understand form accessibility standards (WCAG compliance)

### 3. Advanced Image Maps (03_imagemap)
- **Complex coordinate mapping** for irregular shapes
- **Polygon coordinates** for precise area definition
- **JavaScript integration** for dynamic image maps
- **Responsive image maps** that scale with images
- **Accessibility enhancements**: focus indicators, keyboard navigation
- **Alternative navigation** methods for complex maps
- **Image map debugging** and testing techniques

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Create complex, pixel-perfect interactive image areas
- Build responsive image maps that work across devices
- Enhance image map accessibility beyond basic requirements
- Implement fallback solutions for users who can't use image maps

## Advanced Concepts Covered

### Form Accessibility Deep Dive
- **Screen reader compatibility**: proper markup for assistive technology
- **Error prevention and recovery**: inline validation, clear error messages
- **Cognitive accessibility**: clear instructions, predictable behavior
- **Motor accessibility**: appropriate target sizes, keyboard alternatives

### Security Considerations
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** for iframe embedding
- **Sandboxing attributes** to limit iframe capabilities
- **Cross-origin considerations** when embedding external content
- **User input sanitization** principles (though backend implementation)

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy loading** for embedded content
- **Resource optimization** for multimedia embeds
- **Progressive enhancement** strategies
- **Graceful degradation** for older browsers

## File Structure

Each topic includes:
- **`example.html`** - Comprehensive examples with detailed comments
- **`task_solution.html`** - Complete, production-ready solutions
- **`TASK.md`** - Challenging exercises with real-world scenarios
- **Supporting assets** - Images, stylesheets, and other resources

## Best Practices Emphasized

### Accessibility First
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** for all interactive elements
- **Keyboard navigation** support for all functionality
- **Screen reader optimization** with proper ARIA usage
- **Color contrast** and visual accessibility considerations

### Security Awareness
- **Validate all user input** (client and server-side)
- **Sanitize embedded content** to prevent XSS attacks
- **Use HTTPS** for all external embeds when possible
- **Implement proper CSP headers** for iframe security

### User Experience
- **Progressive enhancement** - start with basic HTML, enhance with CSS/JS
- **Mobile-first responsive design** for all interactive elements
- **Clear visual feedback** for user actions and form states
- **Graceful error handling** with helpful, actionable messages

## Prerequisites

Before starting Intermediate HTML, you should:
- ✅ Complete HTML Fundamentals Beginner level
- ✅ Understand semantic HTML structure and elements
- ✅ Be familiar with HTML attributes and their purposes
- ✅ Have basic CSS knowledge for styling and layout
- ✅ Understand web accessibility principles

## Learning Path

1. **Start with IFrames and Embeds** - Learn to safely integrate external content
2. **Master Accessible Forms** - Create user-friendly, inclusive form experiences
3. **Advanced Image Maps** - Build sophisticated interactive image interfaces

## Real-World Applications

### IFrames and Embeds
- Embedding payment processors (Stripe, PayPal)
- Integrating maps (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)
- Social media widgets and feeds
- Third-party authentication (OAuth)
- Customer support chat widgets

### Accessible Forms
- User registration and login systems
- E-commerce checkout processes
- Contact forms and feedback systems
- Survey and questionnaire interfaces
- Job application forms

### Advanced Image Maps
- Interactive building floor plans
- Product catalog with hotspots
- Educational diagrams and infographics
- Interactive artwork and exhibitions
- Complex navigation interfaces

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### IFrame Security Issues
- **Problem**: Embedding untrusted content without restrictions
- **Solution**: Use sandbox attributes and CSP headers appropriately

### Form Accessibility Gaps
- **Problem**: Forms that work visually but fail with screen readers
- **Solution**: Proper labeling, ARIA attributes, and keyboard testing

### Image Map Responsiveness
- **Problem**: Image maps breaking on different screen sizes
- **Solution**: Use CSS and JavaScript for responsive coordinate scaling

## Assessment Criteria

By the end of this section, you should demonstrate:
- ✅ **Security awareness** in embedding external content
- ✅ **Accessibility expertise** in form design and implementation
