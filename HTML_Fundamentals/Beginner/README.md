# HTML Fundamentals - Beginner Level

Welcome to HTML Fundamentals for beginners! This section covers the essential building blocks of web development using HTML (HyperText Markup Language).

## What You'll Learn

HTML is the foundation of all web pages. It provides structure and meaning to content through semantic markup. This beginner course will teach you how to create well-structured, accessible web pages from scratch.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Lists and Links (01_lists_links)
- **Ordered lists** (`<ol>`) for numbered items
- **Unordered lists** (`<ul>`) for bullet points
- **Description lists** (`<dl>`) for term-definition pairs
- **Anchor tags** (`<a>`) for navigation and linking
- **Link attributes**: `href`, `target`, `title`
- **Internal vs external links**

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Create different types of lists for various content needs
- Build navigation menus and link structures
- Understand link accessibility best practices

### 2. Images and Tables (02_images_tables)
- **Image elements** (`<img>`) with proper attributes
- **Alt text** for accessibility and SEO
- **Responsive images** with `srcset` and `sizes`
- **Table structure**: `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`
- **Table cells**: `<th>` (headers) and `<td>` (data)
- **Table accessibility** with scope and caption

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Implement accessible images with descriptive alt text
- Create structured, semantic tables for data presentation
- Understand when to use tables vs other layout methods

### 3. Semantic Structure (03_semantic_structure)
- **Document structure**: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- **Meta information**: `<title>`, meta tags, charset
- **Semantic elements**: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
- **Headings hierarchy**: `<h1>` through `<h6>`
- **Content grouping**: `<div>` vs semantic alternatives

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Structure pages with meaningful semantic HTML
- Create proper document outlines with heading hierarchy
- Understand the importance of semantic markup for accessibility and SEO

### 4. Image Maps (04_imagemap)
- **Image map concepts** and use cases
- **Area elements** (`<area>`) for clickable regions
- **Coordinate systems**: rect, circle, poly
- **Alternative text** for map areas
- **Image map accessibility considerations

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Create interactive image maps for complex images
- Understand coordinate mapping and shape definitions
- Implement accessible image maps with proper fallbacks

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Lists and Links** - Master the basics of content organization and navigation
2. **Move to Images and Tables** - Learn to present visual content and tabular data
3. **Understand Semantic Structure** - Build properly structured, meaningful documents
4. **Explore Image Maps** - Add interactivity to images (advanced beginner topic)

## File Structure

Each topic includes:
- **`example.html`** - Demonstrates core concepts with clear examples
- **`task_solution.html`** - Complete solution for practice exercises
- **`TASK.md`** - Detailed instructions for hands-on practice
- **Supporting files** - CSS, images, or other assets as needed

## Best Practices Covered

- **Accessibility First**: Always include alt text, use semantic markup, ensure keyboard navigation
- **SEO Optimization**: Proper heading structure, meaningful content organization
- **Performance**: Optimize images, use appropriate file formats
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable HTML with proper indentation and comments
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Standard HTML that works everywhere

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, or similar)
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic understanding of file systems and folders

## How to Use This Section

1. **Read the concepts** in each topic's files
2. **Study the examples** to see practical implementations
3. **Complete the tasks** to practice what you've learned
4. **Compare your work** with the provided solutions
5. **Experiment** with variations and additional features

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Missing alt attributes** on images
- **Incorrect heading hierarchy** (skipping levels)
- **Using tables for layout** instead of semantic elements
- **Forgetting closing tags** or proper nesting
- **Not validating HTML** for syntax errors

## Next Steps

After completing the Beginner level:
- Progress to **Intermediate HTML** for forms and multimedia
- Learn **CSS** for styling and layout
- Explore **JavaScript** for interactivity
- Study **accessibility standards** in depth
