- Form validation messages
- Status updates
- Toast notifications
- Progress indicators

### Benefits & Drawbacks

**Benefits:**
- Ensures screen reader users are informed of dynamic changes
- Improves overall accessibility of modern web applications
- Provides control over announcement priority

**Drawbacks:**
- Overuse can create noisy experiences
- Requires careful planning to avoid overwhelming users
- Implementation varies across screen readers

## Web Components

Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable HTML elements with encapsulated functionality.

### Key Concepts

- Custom Elements API
- Shadow DOM for style encapsulation
- HTML Templates
- Lifecycle callbacks
- Component composition

### Practical Applications

- Reusable UI components
- Design systems implementation
- Widgets that work across frameworks
- Encapsulated third-party components

### Benefits & Drawbacks

**Benefits:**

- Reliable experiences in poor network conditions

### Benefits & Drawbacks

**Benefits:**
- Works offline or on low-quality networks
- Installable without app store
- Linkable and discoverable via search engines
- Push notification capabilities

**Drawbacks:**
- Limited access to native device features
- Service worker debugging can be complex
- iOS support limitations
- Browser support variations

## Intersection Observer

The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or the viewport.

### Key Concepts

- Viewport intersection detection
- Callback functions for visibility changes
- Threshold configuration
- Root element and margin options
- Performance benefits over scroll events

### Practical Applications

- Infinite scroll implementation
- Animations triggered by scrolling
- Analytics tracking for viewability
- Sticky header implementation

### Benefits & Drawbacks

**Benefits:**
- More performant than scroll event listeners
- Asynchronous operation doesn't block the main thread
- Configurable thresholds for precise control

**Drawbacks:**
- IE doesn't support it (requires polyfill)
- Complex configurations can be hard to debug
- Might not be necessary for simple use cases
