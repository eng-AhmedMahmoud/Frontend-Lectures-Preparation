# CSS Box Model & Layout - Practice Task

## Overview
Master the CSS box model, spacing, positioning, and display properties by building a complete blog layout. You'll learn how elements take up space, how to control their positioning, and how to create professional layouts using fundamental CSS concepts.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this task, you will:
- Understand and apply the CSS box model effectively
- Control spacing with margin and padding
- Use different display properties appropriately
- Implement basic positioning techniques
- Create layouts using box model principles
- Handle content overflow and scrolling

## Task Requirements

### 1. Box Model Fundamentals
- Apply `box-sizing: border-box` to all elements for predictable sizing
- Create containers with specific width/height that include padding and borders
- Demonstrate the difference between content-box and border-box sizing
- Use consistent spacing throughout the design

### 2. Header Layout
- Create a full-width header with proper padding
- Implement a navigation bar using inline-block elements
- Add hover effects that don't break the layout
- Ensure header content is properly centered and spaced

### 3. Article Cards System
- Build article cards with consistent dimensions
- Apply proper padding for readability
- Add borders and border-radius for visual appeal
- Implement card hover effects using box-shadow and transform

### 4. Sidebar Design
- Create a sidebar with fixed width that sticks to one side
- Use proper margin/padding for content separation
- Implement a sticky positioning for sidebar content
- Add background colors and borders for visual definition

### 5. Content Spacing
- Use margin for space between elements
- Apply padding for inner content spacing
- Create consistent vertical rhythm throughout the page
- Implement proper text spacing for readability

### 6. Image Handling
- Control image sizing within content areas
- Handle image overflow in containers
- Add proper spacing around images
- Implement responsive image behavior

### 7. Footer Layout
- Create a full-width footer with centered content
- Apply consistent padding and margin
- Add separator borders or background colors
- Ensure footer sticks to bottom when content is short

### 8. Interactive Elements
- Style buttons with proper padding and hover states
- Create form inputs with consistent spacing
- Implement focus states that don't break layout
- Add loading states or disabled styles

### 9. Responsive Behavior
- Ensure box model works across different screen sizes
- Adjust padding/margins for mobile devices
- Stack elements appropriately on smaller screens
- Maintain proper spacing at all viewport sizes

### 10. Advanced Layout Techniques
- Use positioning for overlay elements or badges
- Implement z-index for layered content
- Create floating elements that don't break layout
- Handle content overflow with appropriate scrolling

## Bonus Challenges
- Create a CSS-only tooltip using positioning
- Implement a sticky navigation that changes on scroll
- Build a image gallery with consistent spacing
- Add loading skeletons using box model techniques
- Create responsive typography that scales with container size

## Files to Work With
- **`task.html`** - Blog layout structure with articles, sidebar, and navigation
- **`task_solution.css`** - Your CSS implementation demonstrating box model mastery

## HTML Structure Overview
The HTML includes:
- Header with navigation and branding
- Main content area with article cards
- Sidebar with widgets and additional navigation
- Footer with links and contact information
- Various content types to test box model understanding

## Success Criteria
Your completed task should demonstrate:
- ✅ Proper box-sizing implementation throughout
- ✅ Consistent spacing using margin and padding
- ✅ Appropriate use of display properties
- ✅ Effective positioning for layout control
- ✅ Professional-looking card layouts
- ✅ Responsive behavior across screen sizes
- ✅ Clean, organized CSS with good spacing practices

## Key Concepts to Demonstrate

### Box Model Components
- **Content**: The actual content area
- **Padding**: Space inside the element, around content
- **Border**: The border around padding and content
- **Margin**: Space outside the element, between elements

### Display Properties
- **Block**: Full width, new line, accepts width/height
- **Inline**: Only content width, no line break, ignores width/height
- **Inline-block**: Inline flow but accepts width/height
- **None**: Element not displayed

### Positioning Types
- **Static**: Default flow positioning
- **Relative**: Positioned relative to normal position
- **Absolute**: Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor
- **Fixed**: Positioned relative to viewport
- **Sticky**: Switches between relative and fixed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting to use box-sizing: border-box
- Using margin when padding is more appropriate (or vice versa)
- Not accounting for default browser margins/padding
- Creating layouts that break with different content lengths
- Overusing absolute positioning
- Not testing responsive behavior

## Testing Requirements
After completing your CSS:
1. ✅ Test layout with different content lengths
2. ✅ Verify spacing is consistent throughout
3. ✅ Check responsive behavior on mobile
4. ✅ Ensure hover effects don't break layout
5. ✅ Test with browser developer tools to inspect box model
6. ✅ Validate that positioning works as expected

## Debugging Tips
- Use browser developer tools to inspect the box model
- Add temporary borders to see element boundaries
- Check for collapsed margins between elements
- Verify z-index stacking contexts
- Test with content of different lengths

## Time Estimate
- **Beginner**: 4-5 hours
- **With experience**: 2-3 hours
