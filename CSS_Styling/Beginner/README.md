## Basic Selectors

Understanding CSS selectors is fundamental to styling web pages. Selectors allow you to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them.

### Key Concepts

- Element selectors (targeting HTML tags)
- Class selectors with `.` prefix
- ID selectors with `#` prefix
- Universal selector `*`
- Grouping selectors with commas
- Selector specificity and cascade rules

### Practical Applications

- Styling navigation menus
- Creating consistent typography
- Applying brand colors across elements
- Building reusable component styles
- Form styling and input targeting

### Benefits & Drawbacks

**Benefits:**
- Simple to learn and understand
- Provides precise control over element styling
- Forms the foundation for all CSS styling
- Enables modular, maintainable stylesheets

**Drawbacks:**
- Overuse of ID selectors can create specificity issues
- Deep nesting can make styles hard to maintain
- Generic element selectors can have unintended consequences

- Accessibility considerations with relative units

### Practical Applications
