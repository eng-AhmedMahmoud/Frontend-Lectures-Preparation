# CSS Basic Properties - Practice Task

## Overview
In this task, you'll practice applying fundamental CSS properties to create a styled webpage. You'll work with text styling, colors, backgrounds, spacing, and the box model to transform a plain HTML structure into an attractive, well-designed page.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this task, you will:
- Apply text styling properties (font, color, alignment)
- Use background colors and gradients effectively
- Implement the CSS box model (margin, padding, border)
- Create visual hierarchy with different font sizes and weights
- Understand how basic CSS properties work together

## Task Requirements

### 1. Page Structure Styling
- Set a light gray background for the body (`#f0f0f0`)
- Center the main container and give it a white background
- Add appropriate padding and margins to create breathing room

### 2. Header Design
- Style the header with a dark background (`#333`) and white text
- Make the title 32px with letter spacing for emphasis
- Ensure the header stands out as the primary navigation area

### 3. Navigation Enhancement

- Add hover effects to improve user interaction
- Use colors that maintain good contrast for accessibility

### 4. Content Areas
- Give article sections appropriate padding and margins
- Create visual separation between different content blocks

- Add padding and borders to make them visually distinct
- Use appropriate text colors for good contrast

### 6. Interactive Elements
- Make buttons look clickable with:
  - Proper padding and border-radius

- Center the text and add appropriate padding
- Ensure consistency with the overall design theme

### Bonus Challenges
